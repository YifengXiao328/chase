- **Automotive**: Demonstration of the `chase` tool on a Automotive,
    double-priority communication bus with real time intervals and resources
    contention.
- **Terraswarm**: Demonstration of the `chase` tool on an aircraft power
    distribution network without real time intervals in the specification.
    Presented at the *TerraSwarm Annual Meeting* held in Berkeley on the 
    26 and 27 October 2016.
- **Timing**: Demonstration of the `chase` tool on an aircraft power
    distribution network with real time intervals in the specification.
